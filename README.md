# DAT-301---Project-1-2
This project explores global population trends and their relationship with economic metrics using R and Python. It analyzes population growth (1980–2023), density patterns, and GDP trends (1999–2022), uncovering correlations between population size, GDP, and economic performance through visualizations created with ggplot2, pandas, and seaborn.
